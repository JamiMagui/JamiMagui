This is the first app I've built entirely from scratch.

It was a challenge from the Scrimba program. I designed it to perfectly match the example given.

Features I added:
-Random character generator through Math.Random
-Function to build a password from the random characters
-Ability to change the length of the password through an entry box
-Limited to 5-20 characters. Will not generate if it does not meet these parameters
-Click to copy to clipboard - will only work on a generated password (also logs pw to console)
-Alert box when you try to generate a pw without the proper parameters
-Alery box when you have copied pw to clipboard

Future features I am hoping to add:
-Ability to choose to include characters, upper and lowercase letters
