            I have been working in the equine industry for over a decade. Prior to my work with equines, I functioned in the world of cyber security. I run a small business training horses and training people how to work with horses. While my business is successful, it is not lucrative.<p>
                My interest in web development started at a young age. It has not been a priority until recently when I determined that a career in web development would be beneficial to both my personal life and my business. I wish to use my skills and interests in development to nurse a fruitful career that provides me with the activities and income I require to sustain a level of happiness that cannot be obtained through my equine career alone. <p>
                    While I've always been a hard worker, I strive to work in an industry that promotes work ethic and the desire to further my skills with adequate compensation and the ability to create something I can truly be proud of.</p>
